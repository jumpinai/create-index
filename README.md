# create-index
All files in any directory (including files in subdirectories) can be written to the html file to generate a directory index, which is convenient for finding and browsing files.

Usage:
1. Copy the file (main.bat) to any directory
2. Double-click to run main.bat
3. Find the dir_index.html file in the same directory as main.bat
4. Use the browser to open the dir_index.html file
5. Find the file by searching for the dir_index.html, and click to open the corresponding file
